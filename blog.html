        1. difference of map,filter ,foreach,find <br>
        <u>Ans</u>: map : Applies a function to each element of an array and returns a new array with the results.<br>
        filter : Filters an array by returning only the elements that meet a certain condition. <br>
        foreach : Iterates through an array and executes a function for each element. <br>

        2.difference of local storage,session storage,and cookies?<br>
        <u>Ans</u>: Local storage and session storage are stored in the browser's local storage, while cookies are
        stored in the user's browser. This means that local storage and session storage are only available to the
        website that created them, while cookies can be accessed by any website that the user visits.Local storage and
        session storage can be accessed by all pages on the website. Cookies, on the other hand, can only be accessed by
        the page that set the cookie. <br><br>

        3.what is event loop.how it works.? <br>
        <u>Ans</u>: The event loop is a JavaScript concept that allows the browser to process events and execute code
        asynchronously.
        The event loop starts by checking the queue of events. If there are any events in the queue, the event loop will
        start processing them.
        The event loop will process the events in the queue one by one. When an event is processed, the browser will
        execute the code that is associated with the event.
        If there are no events in the queue, the event loop will check to see if there is any code that is scheduled to
        be executed. If there is any code that is scheduled to be executed, the event loop will execute the code.
        If there is no code that is scheduled to be executed, the event loop will go back to step 1 and check the queue
        of events again.
        The event loop will continue to loop through these steps until there are no more events to process and no more
        code to execute.
